Revision history for JSON-Schema-Tiny

0.027     2024-11-17 16:51:42Z
          - bump builtin::compat prereq for compatibility issues

0.026     2024-11-16 22:05:15Z
          - some performance optimizations for schema traversal and evaluation
          - is_equal() utility function, and the const and enum keywords, now
            provide more detailed error diagnostics
          - numeric type checking is relaxed, now allowing for dualvars
            arising from the simple case of using a number in string context
            or a string in numeric context (only a problem in perls <5.36)

0.025     2024-06-11 20:17:39Z

0.023     2024-04-17 17:55:32Z
          - remove use of JSON::MaybeXS, to avoid potential use of JSON::XS;
            now we use Cpanel::JSON::XS or JSON::PP directly, using the same
            environment variables as in Mojo::JSON for customization.

          - fix bad handling of empty patterns in "pattern",
            "patternProperties" keywords
          - use bignum calculations for any non-integer in "multipleOf", to
            better handle overflows on older architectures

          - the "specification_version" configuration option now accepts

            large to produce the expected error

0.008     2021-08-03 03:50:09Z
          - better handling of blessed data types and other references
          - support for specification versions draft7 and draft2020-12,
            through the "$schema" keyword and the new $SPECIFICATION_VERSION
            variable

0.007     2021-07-22 05:20:31Z

          - the $MOJO_BOOLEANS option is now $SCALARREF_BOOLEANS (all JSON
            backends support them, not just Mojo::JSON)

0.006     2021-06-06 18:20:19Z
          - properly update initial_schema_uri in the state object while passing
            through $id keywords, to keep error locations accurate

0.005     2021-06-05 17:56:50Z
          - errors are no longer generated on the presence of unsupported
            keywords from other draft specification versions
          - now checking syntax for the keywords: $id, $anchor,
            $recursiveAnchor, $vocabulary, $comment

          - keywords in the applicator vocabulary are now applied before the
            keywords in the validation vocabulary (true/false results are not
            affected, but the order of annotations and errors will change)

0.002     2021-04-08 23:46:59Z
