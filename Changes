Revision history for JSON-Schema-Tiny

{{$NEXT}}
          - better handling of blessed data types and other references
          - support for specification version draft7, through the "$schema"
            keyword and the new $SPECIFICATION_VERSION variable

          - add incomplete prereq declaration for Mojo::URL
          - skip acceptance test for integer overflow when nvsize is too
            large to produce the expected error
          - fix parsing of $recursiveAnchor in inner scope
          - the $MOJO_BOOLEANS option is now $SCALARREF_BOOLEANS (all JSON
            backends support them, not just Mojo::JSON)

0.006     2021-06-06 18:20:19Z
          - properly update initial_schema_uri in the state object while passing
            through $id keywords, to keep error locations accurate

          - errors are no longer generated on the presence of unsupported
            keywords from other draft specification versions
          - now checking syntax for the keywords: $id, $anchor,
            $recursiveAnchor, $vocabulary, $comment

0.004     2021-05-21 05:03:42Z
          - new optional OO interface for options, as an alternative to global
            variables

          - fixed error strings used for failing "dependentRequired"
          - keywords in the applicator vocabulary are now applied before the
            keywords in the validation vocabulary (true/false results are not
            affected, but the order of annotations and errors will change)

0.002     2021-04-08 23:46:59Z
          - new config option $MOJO_BOOLEANS, which will treat \0, \1 in data
